# flight_route_optimisation
This project aims to optimize flight routes using multi-criteria decision-making algorithms, considering factors like cost, time, and layovers. It provides users with the most efficient travel path using algorithms such as Bellman-Ford, integrated into an interactive Streamlit GUI for easy exploration.
